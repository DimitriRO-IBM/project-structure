<B>SACR</B> application itself does not contain or store any Personal Data. In particular the data extracted
by SACR from SRM (Server Resource Management) does not contain any Personal Data.
But the SACR team maintains a list of User IDs of persons who install SACR, to know how
many people use use the tool and to be able to contact them if necessary (for example to inform them about
new releases). This data is shared only within the SACR development team.<BR>
