<B>Datacenter</B><BR>
A Datacenter is the primary container of inventory objects
such as ESX and Virtual Machines (VMs). From the Datacenter,
you can add and organize inventory objects. Typically you add
ESX and Clusters to a Datacenter.<BR><BR>
VCenter Server can obtain multiple Datacenters. Large companies
might use multiple Datacenters to represent organizational
units in their enterprise.<BR><BR>
Inventory objects can interact within Datacenters, but interaction
across Datacenters is limited. For examle, you can move a Virtual
Machine with vMotion technology across ESX within a Datacenter
but not to en ESW in another Datacenter.<BR>

<B>Datasore</B><BR>
Datastores in vSphere are storage containers for files. They could
be located on a local server hard drive or across the network on a SAN.
Datastores hide the specifics of each storage device and provide a
uniform model for storing virtual machine files.<BR>
<BR>
Datastores are used to hold virtual machine files, templates, and ISO images.
They can be formatted with VMFS (Virtual Machine File System, a clustered
file system from VMware), or with a file system native to the storage
provider (in the case of a NAS/NFS device).<BR>
<BR>

<B>Cluster</B><BR>
A Cluster is a group of ESX. When you add an ESX to a Cluster,
the ESX resources become part of the Cluster's resources.
The Cluster manages the resources of all ESX within it.<BR><BR>
Clusters enable the Vphere High Availability (HA) end VSphere
Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) solutions.<BR>
<BR>

<B>ESX</B><BR>
An ESX (or Host) is a computer that uses virtualization software,
such as ESX or ESXi, to run Virtual Machines (VMs).<BR>
ESX provides :<BR>
- The CPU and Memory resources that Virtual Machines use<BR>
- Give to the VMs access to Storage<BR>
- Give to the VMs Network connectivity<BR>
<BR>

<B>Virtual Machines</B><BR>
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software that, like a physical computer,
runs on Operating System and applications. An Operating System 
installed on a Virtual Machine is called "guest Operating System".<BR><BR>
Because every Virtual Machine is an isolated computing environment,
you can use Virtual Machines as desktop or workstation environments,
as testing environments or to consolidate server applications.<BR>
<BR>
In VCenter Server, Virtual Machines run on ESX or Clusters. The same ESX
can run many Virtual Machines.<BR>
